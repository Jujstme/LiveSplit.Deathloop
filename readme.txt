This is a LiveSplit (livesplit.org) component for Dishonored. It removes load times
automatically and automates splitting.

Features:

	Frame-accurate load time removal.

	Automatic reset, start, and split. Automatic splitting can be done on
	mission end screens as well as at a few other common places.

Requirements:

	Dishonored (PC) v1.2 or v1.4 (latest)
	LiveSplit 1.3+

Install:

	Run LiveSplit32BitPatcher.exe once. This makes LiveSplit run as 32-bit
	and won't be required in the next version of LiveSplit.

	Extract LiveSplit.Dishonored.dll to your LiveSplit\Components
	folder. Restart LiveSplit.

	Add "Dishonored" in LiveSplit's Layout Editor. Configure where it
	should split by going to Layout Settings.
